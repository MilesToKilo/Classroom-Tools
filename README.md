# Overview  
Classroom-Tools is a growing collection of resources designed to help educators enhance classroom engagement and streamline course management. This repository is part of an ongoing personal project where I document and share tools that are broadly applicable across various courses. My goal is to make classroom tools more accessible to instructors by providing practical solutions that can simplify grading, foster student engagement, and improve learning outcomes.  

I am starting with general tools that suit a wide range of classroom environments, such as the **PollEverywhere** sub-folder, which processes PollEverywhere survey exports for grading. Over time, I will expand this toolkit with new applications and resources, both general and course-specific, as I explore additional features in R.

This repository is a work in progress, so updates may come gradually as I refine my code and add documentation. I hope that as it grows, **Classroom-Tools** will serve as a helpful resource for educators seeking efficient, adaptable classroom solutions. Follow my repository for more classroom tools, and I hope you enjoy my journey as an educator.
