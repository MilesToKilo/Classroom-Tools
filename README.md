In preparation for teaching, I am putting together resources for my future courses. I am starting with general tools that are applicable to all classrooms, and then I'll post more specific  materials for courses I design in the future. This is an on-going personal project where I want to make classroom tools more accessable for educators. Since I'll be fixing up and documenting my code as a side project, this toolkit might grow slowly; however, I will be contributing to this as I learn new applications with R.
