# PollEverywhere Surveys for Enhanced Student Engagement and Participation  
PollEverywhere surveys are an effective tool to foster student engagement and gauge comprehension in real-time. Traditional in-class questions often leave quieter students unheard, but PollEverywhere allows all students to participate anonymously behind a screen. For instructors, this method provides valuable feedback, highlighting areas that may need clarification before progressing to new material. PollEverywhere can be used as frequently as desired, with each response recorded for grading and participation tracking. Additionally, features like geolocation ensure that students are physically present in class to receive participation credit.  

## About This Repository  
This repository offers an easy way to process PollEverywhere CSV export files, so you can seamlessly award participation points based on survey results. It’s designed specifically for PollEverywhere's exported data structure and integrates with Canvas requirements at the University of California Irvine.  

I’ve included sample data and an organized folder structure to help you run the code and adapt it to your course needs. Testing this process in a “sandbox” Canvas course first is highly recommended to avoid surprises in a live course.  

## Getting Started  
**Set Up the Repository**: Clone or download this repository and follow the folder structure to organize your PollEverywhere export files.  
**Run Example Data**: Experiment with the provided example data to see how the code processes responses and assigns participation points.  
**Test in Sandbox Mode**: Before integrating into a live course, test the code on practice surveys in a sandbox Canvas course to ensure smooth implementation.  

## Why Use PollEverywhere?  
Integrating PollEverywhere surveys into your course design can transform the learning experience. I’m passionate about leveraging these tools to create inclusive and dynamic classroom environments, and I hope this repository empowers you to do the same. Good luck, and here’s to more engaged classrooms!
